# books-api
This project is an online library management API built with FastAPI. It allows user registration, authentication, and borrowing/returning books. Features include managing book inventory, tracking borrowing history, and ensuring book availability. SQLAlchemy is used for database management, with Alembic for migrations and Oracle as the database.
